		\item At any time during discussion, the Endorser may cease endorsing the Policy. If no Committee Members endorse the Policy, discussion is dropped.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Once all Submitter(s) and the Endorser are satisfied with the state of the Policy, the Policy will go to a vote by the Committee Members present at the Policy Meeting. If a Committee member is not present at the Policy Meeting, they may choose to vote remotely as an absentee.
